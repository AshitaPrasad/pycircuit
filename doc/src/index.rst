pycircuit's documentation!
=====================================

Summary
-------

pycircuit is an electric circuit analysis package written in Python. In addition to the circuit analysis part it provides post-processing functionality and interfaces to other simulators.

Some are where pycircuit can be useful are:

* Prototyping of new circuit analysis methods
* As a help for doing tedious MNA-formulation of electric circuits
* Symbolic analysis of circuits
* n-port data manipulation
* post-processing of data that is generated by other simulators such as Spectre and Eldo
